🛡️ Cyber Guardian Dashboard
Welcome to the Cyber Guardian Dashboard! This project offers an intuitive interface for monitoring and assessing network vulnerabilities using Nmap. 🚀🔍

📜 Overview
The Cyber Guardian Dashboard leverages Nmap, a robust network scanning tool, to identify open ports and services on networked systems. Its purpose is to help IT and cybersecurity professionals quickly assess potential vulnerabilities in their networks through a user-friendly visualization.

🚀 Features
Nmap Integration: Perform detailed network scans with ease.
Vulnerability Visualization: Intuitive display of scan results for actionable insights.
Real-Time Monitoring: Keep tabs on network vulnerabilities as they arise.
Customizable Scans: Tailor scan parameters to meet your specific needs.
⚙️ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

Python 3.x: Download it here.
Flask: Install it via pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install Flask
Nmap: Install it using your system’s package manager. For instance, on Kali Linux:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install nmap
🛠️ Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cyber-guardian-dashboard.git
cd cyber-guardian-dashboard
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Your Environment: Ensure Nmap is installed and accessible from your system's PATH.

🏃 Running the Application
Start the Flask Server:
Run the app on a specified port (e.g., 5001 if 5000 is in use):

bash
Copy code
python3 app.py
If you encounter a port conflict, modify the app.run() call in app.py to specify an available port:

python
Copy code
app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
Access the Dashboard:
Open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000
🧩 Project Structure
app.py: The main application file that initializes and runs the Flask server.
dashboard.html: HTML template for presenting scan results.
dashboard.js: JavaScript file for dynamic content handling.
scanner.py: Backend script for processing scans and interfacing with Nmap.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies list.
🔍 Example Usage
Run a Scan: Use the web interface to initiate a network scan.
View Results: Analyze the detailed visualization of open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
Take Action: Use the data to address detected vulnerabilities promptly.
